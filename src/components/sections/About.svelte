			<p>
				My journey in technology began with childhood curiosity, blossoming into a passion for web
				development at 16 when I wrote my first "Hello World" in HTML.
			</p>
			<p>
				From mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I ventured into PHP and Laravel, building numerous
				personal projects along the way. My quest for knowledge led me to Node.js, where I honed my
				skills in both frontend and backend development.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, I'm proficient in modern web technologies like TypeScript, Express, and Next.js. My
				GitHub showcases a portfolio of projects that reflect my growth and expertise in creating
				robust, secure web applications.
